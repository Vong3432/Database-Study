		<p class="lead">-File-based system is a collection of application programs that perform services for the end-users,such as production of reports.Each program defines and manages its own data.</p>

		<p class="lead">
			-Typically,the files are labeled and stored in one or more cabinets.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
			-For security,the cabinets may have locks or may be located in secure areas of the building.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
			-When we need to look something up,we go to the filing system and search through the system,starting at the first entry,until we find what we want.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
			-The manual filing system works well as long as the number of the items to be stored is small.

				Separation and isolation of data
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-When data is isolated in separate files,it is more difficult to access data that should be available.
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-For example,if we want to produce a list of all houses that match the requirements of clients,we first need to create a temporary file of those clients who have "house" as the preferred type.
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-With file systems,such processing is difficult.The application developer must synchronize the processing of two files to ensure that the correct data is extracted.
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-The difficulty is compounded if we require data from more than two files.
			</p>

			<p class="lead font-weight-bold">
				Duplication of data
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-Owing to the decentralized approach taken by each department,the file-based approach encouraged,if not necessitated,the uncontrolled duplication of data.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Duplication is wasteful.It costs time and money to enter the data more than once.
				</li>
				<li>It takes up additional storage space,again with associated costs.Often,the duplication of data can be avoided by sharing data files.</li>
				<li>Duplication can lead to loss of data integrity;in other words,the data is no longer <span class="font-weight-bold">consistent</span>.
				</li>

				<li>For example,if a member of staff moves and the change of address is told only yo HR and not to Payroll,the person's paycheck will be sent to the wrong address
				</li>

				<li>
					Another example,if an employee is promoted with an associated increase in salary,and the change is only announced to HR,but the change does not filter through to Payroll.
				</li>
			</ul>
