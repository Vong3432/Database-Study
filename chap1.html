		<hr>

		<div class="row">
		<p class="lead">-File-based system is a collection of application programs that perform services for the end-users,such as production of reports.Each program defines and manages its own data.</p>

		<p class="lead">
			-Typically,the files are labeled and stored in one or more cabinets.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
			-For security,the cabinets may have locks or may be located in secure areas of the building.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
			-When we need to look something up,we go to the filing system and search through the system,starting at the first entry,until we find what we want.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
			-The manual filing system works well as long as the number of the items to be stored is small.
		</p>

				Separation and isolation of data
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-When data is isolated in separate files,it is more difficult to access data that should be available.
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-For example,if we want to produce a list of all houses that match the requirements of clients,we first need to create a temporary file of those clients who have "house" as the preferred type.
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-With file systems,such processing is difficult.The application developer must synchronize the processing of two files to ensure that the correct data is extracted.
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-The difficulty is compounded if we require data from more than two files.
			</p>			

		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<p class="lead font-weight-bold">
				Duplication of data
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				-Owing to the decentralized approach taken by each department,the file-based approach encouraged,if not necessitated,the uncontrolled duplication of data.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Duplication is wasteful.It costs time and money to enter the data more than once.
				</li>
				<li>It takes up additional storage space,again with associated costs.Often,the duplication of data can be avoided by sharing data files.</li>
				<li>Duplication can lead to loss of data integrity;in other words,the data is no longer <span class="font-weight-bold">consistent</span>.
				</li>

				<li>For example,if a member of staff moves and the change of address is told only to HR and not to Payroll,the person's paycheck will be sent to the wrong address
				</li>

				<li>
					Another example,if an employee is promoted with an associated increase in salary,and the change is only announced to HR,but the change does not filter through to Payroll.Now,the employee is receiving the wrong salary,it takes time and effort to resolve when this error is detected.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<p class="lead font-weight-bold">Data dependence</p>

				<p class="lead">
					-As mentioned,the physical structure and storage of the data files and records are defined in the application code.This means that changes to an existing structure are difficult to make.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					-For example,increasing the size of a <span class="toItalic">PropertyForRent</span> address field from 40 to 41 characters require the creation of a one-off program(that is,a program that is run only once and can then be discarded) that converts <span class="toItalic">PropertyForRent</span> to the new format.
				</p>

				<img src="image/t1.png" class="img-fluid" style="width: 100%;object-fit: contain;">
				<div class="row">
				<p class="lead">
					- This program has to :
					<ul>
						<li>Open the original PropertyForRent file for reading</li>
						<li>Open a temporary file with the new structure</li>
						<li>Read a record from the original file,convert the data to conform to the new structure,and write it into a temporary file,then retest them.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<p class="lead font-weight-bold">
					Incompatible file formats
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					-Since the structure of files is embedded in the application programs,the structures are dependent on the application programming language.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					-For example,the structure of a file that generated by a COBOL program maybe differemt from the structure of a file that generated by a C program.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					-Another example,the Contracts Department wants to find the names and addresses of all owners whose property is currently rented out.Unfortunately,Contracts does not hold the details of property owners;only the Sales Department holds these.However,Contracts has the property number (<span class="toItalic">propertyNo</span>),which can be used to find the corresponding property number in the Sales Department's <span class="toItalic">PropertyForRent</span> file.
				</p>

			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<p class="lead font-weight-bold">
					Fixed queries/proliferation of application programs
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					-From the end-user's point of view,file-based systems were a great improvement over manual systems.Consequently,the requirement for new or modified queries grew.However,file-based systems are very dependent upon the application developer,who has to write any queries or reports that are required.As a result,two things happened.

						<li></li>
